# RTL-to-GDS-Implementation-of-Low-Power-Configurable-Multi-Clock-Digital-System-
The project is responsible for receiving commands through the UART receiver to do different system functions such as register file reading/writing or doing some processing using ALU block and sending results as well as CRC bits of result using 4 bytes frame through UART transmitter communication protocol.
